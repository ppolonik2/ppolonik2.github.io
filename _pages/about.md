I am a postdoc at UC San Diego as part of the School of Global Policy & Strategy and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as part of the Ricke and Burney groups.

**I use statistical and numerical models to study human-environment interactions, focusing on the impacts of climate change and air pollution.**

Our understanding of climate science has advanced dramatically over the past few decades and we now recognize that human decisions will drive our collective future. My goal is to help quantify how adding people into our current understanding of physical science changes our climate and equity trajectories. 

I enjoy this work because it allows me to apply my background in Earth science to policy-relevant questions in new and creative ways using a wide range of methods. I get to learn about and contribute to both Earth science and current public conversations.

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with friends, running, biking, playing soccer, hiking, camping, visiting National Parks, and taking pictures.
