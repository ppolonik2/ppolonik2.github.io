## Climate Change Studies 101

Instructor, Fall 2022 + 2023 + 2024

Though this course is officially titled Carbon Neutrality at UC, I have tried to make it more broadly about local climate action. It's a two unit course that consists of half lecture/discussion and half guest speakers. Example speakers include transportation and sustainability staff, city sustainability staff, a local reporter, and local NGO staff. We also take tours of campus energy infrastrucutre and LEED certified buildings. The purpose of the class is to gain a practical understanding of the changes required to decarbonize, think broadly about individual and systemic action, and view the world around you through a climate lens.


## SIO 60

Experiences in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences \
TA, Fall 2021

This is a practical introductory course covering a breadth of oceanic and atmospheric sciences. A large portion of the class consists of lab exercises that are meant to foster an intuition for the physic underlying the world around us. This includes things like measuring infrared radiation, understanding hydrostatic pressure through a very long straw, doing rotating tank experiments, and measuring atmospheric and oceanic temperature profiles using a weather balloon and CTD casts. 


## Undergraduate mentorship

I have worked with multiple undergraduate researchers throughout my PhD and postdoc. This includes two summers with REU interns, a longer term undergrad/masters student researcher, and others. I have learned an immense amount about teaching through working with these wonderful people!
