I am a postdoc at UC San Diego as part of the School of Global Policy & Strategy and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as part of the Ricke and Burney groups.

I use statistical and numerical models to study human-environment interactions, focusing on the impacts of climate change and air pollution. 

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
